h1. Couched Model

A simple model that further wraps couchrest, particularly CouchRest::ExtendedDocument, in order to make model life just that much easier for me. This will eventually be the base to my ActiveRecord-Couchdb-Adaptor.

h1. Example

<pre><code>
class Note < CouchedModel
  property :content
  property :priority
end

# ... Somewhere down the line

Note.new(:content => "my first note", :priority => 1).save
</code></pre>

h2. Also with multiple property adding!

<pre><code>
class Note < CouchedModel
  property_accessors :content, :priority
end
</code></pre>

This does not support all the cast_as stuff that ExtendedDocument does, but that's in the works.

h1. Testing

I've added cucumber tests for those interested in forking etc. Just run:

<code>rake cucumber</code>

To see the features run.

h1. To Be Added

This is not even close to where I want to finally be. But I'm not really set on the specs yet. Here's a very short list of my next todo's:

# Dynamic property adding
# Fixing property_accessors to accept property options
